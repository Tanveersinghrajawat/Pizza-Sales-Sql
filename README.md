ðŸš€ Exciting Milestone: My First SQL Project! ðŸš€

I'm thrilled to share my analysis of Pizza Sales from a dataset provided by Ayushi Jain at WsCube Tech.
The aim of this project was to derive key insights and statistics to boost business growth. By addressing the critical questions a stakeholder might have, I focused on:
ðŸ’² Total Revenue, including daily and monthly breakdowns.
âŒ› Total number of orders over specific periods.
ðŸ“Š Orders categorized by pizza types.
ðŸ“ˆ Highest-selling pizzas and cumulative revenue details.
ðŸ”Š Peak hours for pizza sales.
Key Insights:
Sales Tracking: Detailed revenue analysis helps in monitoring business performance.
Identifying Flaws: Pinpointing areas for improvement within the business.
Strategy Development: Crafting better strategies to enhance pizza flavors or service.
Understanding Consumer Preferences: Gaining insights into what customers prefer.
This project has been an incredible opportunity to apply my SQL skills and extract meaningful information from a dataset. Stay tuned for more insights as I continue to explore and analyze different datasets.
